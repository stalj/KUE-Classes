### I am already familiar with the subject of the classes. Do I need to participate in regular classes?

It only depends on you. You will not receive a lower final grade for your absences. However, please take into account that students' attendance may be checked during regular classes. You can then receive bonus points for high attendance at classes.

### I need to get more information about my classes and my participation. How can I do this?

Detailed information about my office hours, their format and dates, is available on my e-card. Generally, start by sending me a post on the Microsoft Teams. I can assure you that 99% of students' issues can be solved by efficient communication on the chat. I try to respond quickly to posts sent by students.


### I have my own laptop. Can I use it during regular classes?

Of course.

### I was absent from regular classes. Where can I send my sick leave?

If it was a regular activity, no problem. No sick leave is required. So please **do NOT send it** to me!!. It is only necessary to submit a sick leave if you were absent during tests.

### I would like to retake the course. What do I need to do?

I invite you to my classes. However, please let me know in advance which group of students you would like to join. I will check the current group sizes and let you know if it is possible.

**Important**: If the name of the course or the number of hours of classes has changed, contact the Student Service Center as soon as possible for further information. You will most likely need to obtain written consent to repeat the course.

### I retake the course. Do I need to take part in regular classes?

You definitely need to take part in tests to pass the course. As for attendance at regular classes, it is up to you. Once you are familiar with the class material, you do not need to attend regular classes. Please note, however, that sometimes you can receive bonus points for attending such classes.

### I have my own laptop. Can I use it during tests?

Unfortunately not. During the test, you can only use university computers available in the university's computer lab.

### Can I use the Internet during the test?

During the test, the Internet connection is unavailable. You can only connect to Moodle to submit your assignments. Also remember that you cannot use any books, notes, or your smartphone during the test. However, you can use textbooks or other materials that are available in the Moodle course.

### A friend asked me to share an assignment during a test. Can I do that?

Do not even try!! Sharing tasks during the test is completely prohibited. If you do this, both you and your friend will fail the entire course. No exceptions.

### I was absent during the test due to illness and I have a sick leave. What should I do?

First, scan your sick leave. Then, upload the scan to Moodle within a maximum of 7 days from the test date. On Moodle, in every test, you will find the option to upload your sick leave scan.

### I was absent during the test, but I do not have a sick leave. Can I complete the test?

Unfortunately, if you do not have a sick leave, you cannot complete the test. However, you still have a chance to pass the course. Try to get a very good score on the remaining tests. When your total points at the end of the semester are equal to or greater than 50%, you will pass the course.

### I scored low on the test. Can I take part in the test again to improve my score?
   
Unfortunately, you cannot improve your test score. However, you can prepare thoroughly for the next tests. If your subsequent test scores are better, you will definitely pass the course. Remember that the condition for passing the course is to obtain at least 50% of all points.

### I received my test result. However, I have doubts whether it was calculated correctly. What can I do?

Immediately after receiving your test result, send me a message on Microsoft Teams. Please provide detailed information as to why you believe your test score was not calculated correctly. I will try to check if the result is correct.

### I have already passed the course in previous years. How to get the final grade?

Your final grade for the course has already been entered by me into the USOS university computer system when you took part in the course. Therefore, please contact the Student Services Center who is responsible for transferring your grades to the current academic year. I do not have such permissions.

### I passed the course. What about my final grade?

Congratulations. I will enter your final grade into the USOS university computer system at the end of the semester.

### Unfortunately, I failed the course. What should I do?

According to the study regulations, you can repeat the course in the next academic year. Please contact the Student Service Center for detailed information.

### I would like to buy a computer that I can use for both classes and everyday use. Any suggestions?

I am not an expert in computer hardware, but I can share with you my many years of experience using a computer. Maybe this information will help you make a decision.

1. Type of computer (desktop or laptop): definitely a laptop, which is a portable computer. You will be able to bring it to classes or take it with you on any trip.

2. Type of laptop: try to avoid the cheapest, low-budget laptops. You can often buy them for around PLN 2,000. Such laptops can even have a quite decent, fast microprocessor. However, you can be sure that the manufacturer had to somehow reduce the production costs of the computer. After some time, you will notice that:

    * the laptop is loud because the cheapest components were used to cool the computer
    * the keyboard is loud and uncomfortable to use
    * the casing is usually plastic and breaks easily
    * the computer components used are usually the cheapest and often break down
    * the laptop does not have high-bandwidth connectors for connecting external devices (e.g. Thunderbolt)
    * it is impossible to connect the computer to a docking station for convenient work, or to charge the laptop battery using modern standards (e.g. power delivery)
    * often after 1-2 years it is not possible to update the operating system (Windows) due to the manufacturer's requirements not being met

    Therefore, consider buying a business model laptop. Every company that produces laptops has models designed for business in its offer. Such a laptop will serve you well during your studies and for everyday use. Unfortunately, it is usually not suitable for gaming. If you are a fan of computer games, buy a separate gaming console (xBox, PlayStation) or a desktop computer with a good processor and an efficient graphics card.

3. Features of a business laptop: they are durable, usually assembled from high-quality components that are rarely damaged, are quiet and comfortable to work with, offer a number of high-bandwidth ports, support modern data transfer standards and laptop battery charging, have a durable, often metal casing.

3. Budget: prices for laptops dedicated to business usually start at PLN 4,000. If you have a budget of at least PLN 8,000 (congratulations!), you can consider buying a MacBook. Especially if you use other devices from this company (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch). If your budget < PLN 8,000, look at business laptops from well-known companies that produce laptops (Dell, Lenovo, ...).

3. Laptop parameters: the topic is very broad. Browse the Internet. You will find a lot of information on this topic there. However, pay attention to:

    * amount of computer RAM: min. 16GB for comfortable work with many applications and websites at the same time
    * disk capacity: 256GB will usually be sufficient. If you regularly record video on your smartphone, consider a larger disk. Remember that for a few zlotys a month you can also store data using disks available on the Internet. This is a very convenient solution.
    * communication protocols: if your laptop supports the Thunderbolt protocol and Power Delivery for battery charging, you will be able to connect it with one cable to the docking station and work comfortably using a large, external monitor and a large, comfortable keyboard (as if you were using a desktop computer).

4. You have small budget (PLN 1,000 to 2,000): don't worry. Check out the offer of 2-3 year old used, post-lease business laptops. There are many stores with used computers, both stationary (at least a few in Krakow) and online, where you can buy a used, solid business laptop for a fraction of its original price. Usually 1000-2000 PLN is enough to buy a good laptop. What's more, stores usually give a one-year warranty for a purchased used laptop. This is, in my opinion, a much better solution than buying a new, but the cheapest laptop.
