# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS





## TAKING PART IN REGULAR CLASSES

### I am already familiar with the subject of the classes. Do I need to participate in regular classes?

It only depends on you. You will not receive a lower final grade for your absences. However, please take into account that students' attendance may be checked during regular classes. You can then receive bonus points for high attendance at classes. Detailed information can be found in the course syllabus.

### I have my own laptop. Can I use it during regular classes?

Of course.

### I was absent from regular classes. Where can I send my sick leave?

If it was a regular activity, no problem. No sick leave is required. So please do not send it anywhere. It is only necessary to submit a sick leave if you were absent during tests.

### I repeat the course. Do I need to take part in regular classes?

You definitely need to take part in tests to pass the course. As for attendance at regular classes, it is up to you. Once you are familiar with the class material, you do not need to attend regular classes. Please note, however, that sometimes you can receive bonus points for attending such classes. Details can be found in the course syllabus.





## PARTICIPATION IN TESTS

### I have my own laptop. Can I use it during tests?

Unfortunately not. During the test, you can only use university computers available in the university's computer lab.

### Can I use the Internet during the test?

During the test, the Internet connection is unavailable. You can only connect to Moodle to submit your assignments. Also remember that you cannot use any books, notes, or your smartphone during the test. However, you can use textbooks or other materials that are available in the Moodle course.

### A friend asked me to share an assignment during a test. Can I do that?

Do not even try!! Sharing tasks during the test is completely prohibited. If you do this, both you and your friend will fail the entire course. No exceptions.

### I was absent during the test due to illness and I have a sick leave. What should I do?

First, scan your sick leave. Then, upload the scan to Moodle within a maximum of 7 days from the test date. On Moodle, in every test, you will find the option to upload your sick leave scan.

### I was absent during the test, but I do not have a sick leave. Can I complete the test?

Unfortunately, if you do not have a sick leave, you cannot complete the test. However, you still have a chance to pass the course. Try to get a very good score on the remaining tests. When your total points at the end of the semester are equal to or greater than 50%, you will pass the course.

### I scored low on the test. Can I take part in the test again to improve my score?
   
Unfortunately, you cannot improve your test score. However, you can prepare thoroughly for the next tests. If your subsequent test scores are better, you will definitely pass the course. Remember that the condition for passing the course is to obtain at least 50% of all points.

### I received my test result. However, I have doubts whether it was calculated correctly. What can I do?

Immediately after receiving your test result, send me a message on Microsoft Teams. Please provide detailed information as to why you believe your test score was not calculated correctly. I will try to check if the result is correct.
