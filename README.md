# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## I took part in the test but got a low score. Can I take part in the test again to improve my score?
   
Unfortunately, you cannot improve your test score. However, you can prepare thoroughly for the next tests. If your subsequent test scores are better, you will definitely pass the course. Remember that the condition for passing the course is to obtain at least 50% of all points.

## I did not take part in the test due to illness and I have a sick leave. What should I do?

First, scan your sick leave. Then, upload the scan to Moodle within a maximum of 7 days from the test date. On Moodle, in every test, you will find the option to upload a sick leave.

## I did not take part in the test, but I do not have a sick leave. Can I complete the test?

Unfortunately, if you do not have a sick leave, you cannot complete the test. However, you still have a chance to pass the course. Try to get a very good score on the remaining tests. When your total points at the end of the semester are equal to or greater than 50%, you will pass the course.

## I repeat the course. Do I need to take part in regular classes?

You definitely need to take part in tests to pass the course. As for attendance at regular classes, it is up to you. Once you are familiar with the class material, you do not need to attend regular classes. Please note, however, that sometimes you can receive additional points for attending such classes. Details can be found in the course syllabus.
