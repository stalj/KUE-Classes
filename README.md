If it was a regular activity, no problem. No sick leave is required. So please do not send it anywhere. It is only necessary to submit a sick leave if you were absent during tests.

### I repeat the course. Do I need to take part in regular classes?

You definitely need to take part in tests to pass the course. As for attendance at regular classes, it is up to you.

Details can be found in the course syllabus.

You can receive bonus points for high attendance at classes. Detailed information can be found in the course syllabus.



## TESTS

### I scored low on the test. Can I take part in the test again to improve my score?
   
Unfortunately, you cannot improve your test score. However, you can prepare thoroughly for the next tests. If your subsequent test scores are better, you will definitely pass the course. Remember that the condition for passing the course is to obtain at least 50% of all points.

### I was absent during the test due to illness and I have a sick leave. What should I do?

First, scan your sick leave. Then, upload the scan to Moodle within a maximum of 7 days from the test date. On Moodle, in every test, you will find the option to upload your sick leave scan.

### I was absent during the test, but I do not have a sick leave. Can I complete the test?

Unfortunately, if you do not have a sick leave, you cannot complete the test. However, you still have a chance to pass the course. Try to get a very good score on the remaining tests. When your total points at the end of the semester are equal to or greater than 50%, you will pass the course.


### Can I use the Internet during the test?

During the test, the Internet connection is unavailable. You can just connect to Moodle to submit your assignments. Also remember that you cannot use any books, notes, or your smartphone during the test. However, you can use textbooks or other materials that are available in the Moodle course.

### A friend asked me to share an assignment during a test. Can I do that?

Sharing tasks during the test is completely prohibited. If you do this, both you and your friend will fail the entire course. No exceptions.
