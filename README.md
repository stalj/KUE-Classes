# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1. I took part in a test but got a low score. Can I take part in the test again to improve my score?
   
   Unfortunately, you cannot improve your test score. However, you can prepare thoroughly for the next tests. If your subsequent test scores are better, you will definitely pass the course. Remember that the condition for passing the course is to obtain at least 50% of all points.

1. I did not take part in the test due to illness and I have a medical leave. What should I do?

   Upload your medical certificate scan to Moodle within a maximum of 7 days from the test date. On Moodle, in every test, you will find the option to send a sick note.
